Project Development Standards and Constraints

This document outlines the mandatory rules and the primary technology stack for all project development, enforcing a highly functional, declarative, and immutable coding style.

I. Core Philosophy

Language: Development must use TypeScript in strict mode for robust type safety.

Style: We always prefer a functional style, focusing on pure functions and immutability.

Declarative Code: All code must be declarative, describing what the program should accomplish, not how to accomplish it.

Documentation: Use context7 to get documentation for libraries used.

II. Mandatory Prohibitions (Non-Negotiable Constraints)

To maintain a pure functional flow, the following features are strictly prohibited in all application logic:

NO for or while loops: Instead, use array methods (.map(), .filter(), .reduce()), utility functions (e.g., from es-toolkit), or recursion.

NO switch conditionals: Instead, use object/Map lookup patterns or chained ternary operators.

NO nested if statements: Instead, use guard clauses (early return) or functional composition of predicates to flatten complexity.

NO else keyword: Logic must be handled via guard clauses, ensuring the if block returns or exits.

NO let keyword: Always use const to enforce immutability for all local variables.

NO inline code comments. They suck.

III. Technology Stack

Frontend Framework: Nuxt 4 and Nuxt UI 4 are the foundation and component library.

Backend & Auth: We use Appwrite for all backend services and user authentication.

Core Utilities: es-toolkit is the primary library for general-purpose utility functions.

Asynchronous Mapping: Use p-map specifically for parallel and concurrent asynchronous mapping operations.

Composables: VueUse is the standard collection of essential Vue composition utilities.
